## Features

- ðŸš€ One-click reset of Cursor editor trial period
- ðŸ’ª Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Notice

Due to restrictions in new Cursor versions, reset functionality will no longer be supported for versions above 45.

Supporting newer versions would require modifying system-level components, which could affect other programs on your computer.

Therefore, we will not support higher versions. If you still want to use this script, please check your Cursor version and download Cursor version below 45.

**Currently, only Cursor version 44.11 has been tested to support fingerprint reset.**

**Versions above 45 are not supported**

**This script was last updated on 2025.02.11, with the following changes:**

The script disables automatic software updates during execution, so if you are a paid Cursor user after using this script, please uninstall and install the latest version
